This is a Clojure service that calls the Control Plane in Kubernetes (Kube API must be running on localhost, via kubectl proxy), to spawn a StatefulSet of multiple Clojure microservice pods, each serving 
[pi-service](https://github.com/wclark-aburra-code/pi-service), so as to parallelize and distribute the computation. It's an "embarrassingly parallelizable" algorithm anyways, so we can bring some state into Kubernetes and actually benefit from it. The streams of results are delivered via Server-Sent Events.
